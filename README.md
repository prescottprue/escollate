# Escollate

Starting with the winning idea from [Small Biz Dev Hackathon Chicago 2014](http://challengepost.com/software/escollate), this project aims continue to provide an open sourced and easy method for buisnesses to understand as well as learn from their data. Escollate provides a user community where buisnesses can ask questions directly with their own stats calculated from data entered/imported into Escollate.

This is an ongoing project and not all of the funcitonality has been tested.
